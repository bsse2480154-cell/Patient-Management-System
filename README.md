# Patient Management System

## About

This is a simple Patient Management System developed in JAVA for beginner-level learning. The project is made to understand how a real-life system works where data needs to be stored, updated, and managed properly.

In this project, patient information such as name, ID, age, etc. can be added and managed using a GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GUI). The GUI is built using JAVA SWING, which allows the user to interact with the system through buttons, text fields, and windows instead of using the command line.

Patient data is saved in a text file so that the records are not lost when the program is closed. This project mainly focuses on learning OOP concepts, basic GUI handling, and file handling in Java.
